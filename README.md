# Whatsapp Clone

Another clone build from Sonny Sangha. In this build I had my second experience
using Next.js

Takeouts from this app:

- Learned about ServerSideProps (vs useEffect)
- Learned about using the useRouter
- Another time practicing react-firebase-hooks and how easy and simple things
  become with it
- Another chance to work with styled components
- An oportunity to make an 101 chat messagin and its data structure for that

See you in my next build.
